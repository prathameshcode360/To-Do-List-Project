# Todo List Project

## Description

This is a simple Todo list application built with vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Additionally, users can filter tasks based on their completion status and perform bulk actions on selected tasks.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to the list using the input field and the "Add" button.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
- **Complete Task**: Each task has a "Complete" button to mark it as completed. A completed task shows a dialog box stating "Task Completed".
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks to show all tasks, only incomplete tasks, or only completed tasks.
- **Bulk Actions**: Users can select multiple tasks using circular checkboxes and perform bulk delete or complete actions.
